   This program shows how to
      - react to keyboard events
      - show numbers in hexadecimal form
 
   This program displays the codes of the pressed keys to the
   screen. It does not always show the typed characters. A single key
   can represent several characters. For example, the A key
   can be used to produce both the uppercase A and the lowercase a.
   The onkeydown and onkeyup events deal with codes of the pressed
   keys, while the onkeypress event can be used to find out
   which character was typed.

<!-- Next we import JavaScript code that allows us to use a function
     named sprintf() which works in the same way as corresponding
     functions in the C language or the String.format() method of Java.

// In the following functions toString( 16 ) is used to convert
// the received key codes into hexadecimal values.

// As the key codes are printed to the (web) console that is available
// in some browsers, it is possible to see in detail what happens
// when keys are pressed. You can find out that onkeypress events are
// generated mainly for the visible characters, and then the received
// character code represents the typed character.

<!-- NOTES:

   The sprintf() function that was 'imported' to this program
   is a nice function to format strings. It is useful to learn to
   use this function as similar formatting mechanisms are used
   in the C, Java, Python, and other languages.

   If the sprintf() function was not in use in this program,
   an almost equivalent output could be produced with a statement like

      context.fillText( "Last pressed key: " +

                        String.fromCharCode( code_of_last_pressed_key ) +

                        "  "  +  code_of_last_pressed_key.toString( 16 ) +

                        "  "  +  code_of_last_pressed_key,
                        100, 200 ) ;
